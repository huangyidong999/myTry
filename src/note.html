    1. How to Create a App with Angular
    For Create a Angular Project<br>
    Using CLI, "ng new yourAppName"

    2. The Interpolation binding synatx in Angular
    we can create a var in component.ts file and use the vat by {{var name}}
    in out html page

    3.Create a Class inside component
    For Creating a class:
    it would be like this,

            import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

        @Component({
        selector: 'app-heroes',
        templateUrl: './heroes.component.html',
        styleUrls: ['./heroes.component.css']
        })
        export class HeroesComponent implements OnInit {

        constructor() { }

        ngOnInit(): void {
        }

        }
    
    First    We Always import Component and Annotate the component class with
     @Component, which is decorator function helping programe to know the data need to use(Offically called metadata)
    
    Second  ngOnInit() is a lifecyle hook, Angular will calls ngOnInit(),
    this is a good place to put some intialization data
    
    Third   Always export the class, cause we need to use it outside

   4. How to Display data from Component in Html pages
   <h1>{{ varName}}</h1>

   We also can create the data stucture by typeScript and import that to our component class to use them,
   like:
        hero: Hero = {
            id: 1,
            name: 'Windstorm'
        }; 
    the hero is our var name in local, the Herp is our import name.
        Code : import { Hero } from '../hero';
    

    If we done the import of data from outplaces, using the complatied data, we may can dispaly other propoties also,
    it would be like this:
        <h2>{{hero.name}} Details</h2>
        <div><span>id: </span>{{hero.id}}</div>
        <div><span>name: </span>{{hero.name}}</div>
    
    5.Two-way binding
    Example:

    <div>
        <label for="name">Hero name: </label>
        <input id="name" [(ngModel)]="hero.name" placeholder="name">
    </div>

    ngModel is the way in Anguar of two way binding. Here we bind the hero.name property with the HTML text input box, so it can
    flow between html text box and the hero.name property

    To use ngModel, we need to import FormsModel to our app.modules.ts file, like this:
        import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms'; // <-- NgModel lives here
    Then add the FormsModule into or metadata's import array:
    
                        imports: [
                    BrowserModule,
                    FormsModule
                    ],
    Again, the explaination above, all is in the file of app.module.ts

    THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT: declar the component into module.ts file
