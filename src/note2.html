<p>
    1. the @Input()
    ngModel is the two-way binding decorotation, the @input is the one way blind from component to html page?
    example in component:
        import { Component, OnInit, Input } from '@angular/core'; 
        @Input() hero?: Hero;

    Firstly, we need to import the Input code.
    Secondly, we just need to decorate hero by @Input()
    then we can use it in front page?

    example in html:
        <app-hero-detail [hero]="selectedHero"></app-hero-detail>

    at here [hero] is from heroDetail component, and the selectedHero is a var which will be set in function in another component 

    2.the way how to use one data in A component on B component
    the hero is decorote by @Input. so the other component can visit the hero's value
